This project is to demonstrate ZK Addon - Timeline and it is distributed under [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that everyone can use this DEMO source code for free.

###Introduction
The timeline is used to visualize events in time, and these events can be placed by setting their own start date and end date. Same as ZK components, you can easily customize and style the contents and the appearance of these events.

A timeline contains two axises, called main axis and sub axis(sub axis can be hidden), you can scroll in the timeline by dragging and using the mouse scroll-wheel.
These two axises are synchronized in scrolling. You can easily zoom in the main axis by dragging the bar in the sub axis, and zoom in the sub axis by pressing the zoom in/zoom out icon on the left side of the sub axis.
